<h1>2017 Donations</h1>
<p>A lot of my success as a consultant comes from the community. I'd like to give
back and support the groups and causes that helped me earn a livelihood.</p>
<p>I was on pace for a record year, but I just learned I'm not getting paid for
work I did in October or November due to some very selfish decisions on behalf
of management at the company I was working with.</p>
<p>How much to give? I follow <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Take-the-Pledge">the recommendations from The Life You Can
Save</a>. I use my pretax income, since most of my
charitable donations are tax deductible.</p>
<p>Note I also make donations as a private citizen, so only some of the donations
I made this year are listed here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$100 to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, making it easy to obtain excellent SSL
certificates. I use Let's Encrypt extensively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$200 to <a href="https://www.projectalloy.org/">Project Alloy</a>, to give underrepresented people
scholarships to attend tech conferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$200 to <a href="https://golangbridge.org/">GoBridge</a>, an organization that teaches Go to
underrepresented groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$50 to <a href="http://www.openbsdfoundation.org/">the OpenBSD Foundation</a>, which works on libressl (among
other things).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$50 to <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, which works on Vim improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$50 to <a href="https://github.com/fatih/vim-go">vim-go</a>, indispensable if you are doing Go development with
Vim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$125 to <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current/">the Software Freedom Conservancy</a> (which hosts Homebrew, Git,
Mercurial and other projects).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$75 to <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$100 to <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$100 to <a href="https://freedom.press/">the Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, which supports Signal.
If you don't want your donation to support Wikileaks, be sure to choose the
right funding campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$200 to the <a href="https://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a>. Many software engineers
working in the US are immigrants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$80 to <a href="https://npmjs.org">npm, Inc</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$50 to <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$200 to <a href="http://carlaef.org/">CARLA</a>. Housing is a critical issue in San Francisco. The
high price of housing has an adverse effect on our communities and makes it
more difficult for people to move here and get a foothold in a fast growing
economy. CARLA fights NIMBY cities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Please tell me how to give you money</h3>
<p>In several cases I wanted to give away money and I couldn't figure out how. It
was too difficult to assess an organization's funding situation and figure out
how to donate money; many projects and groups that (I assume) would appreciate
more money didn't explain how to donate, or what they would do with more money.</p>
<p>At the very least, please add the following to your README:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you need or want more money?</li>
<li>What would you do with more money?</li>
<li>How can I give money to you?</li>
</ol>
<p>At the very least, suggest sending money to a Paypal address; it's not tax
deductible, but it's easy for people to give to you.</p>
