# 2016 Donations

A lot of my success as a consultant comes from the community. I'd like to give
back and support the groups and causes that helped me earn a livelihood.

How much to give? I follow [the recommendations from The Life You Can
Save][giving-recommendation]. I use my pretax income, since most of my
charitable donations are tax deductible.

Note I also make donations as a private citizen, so only some of the donations
I made this year are listed here.

- $200 to [Let's Encrypt][le], making it easy to obtain excellent SSL
certificates. I use Let's Encrypt extensively.

- $200 to [Project Alloy][projectalloy], to give underrepresented people
scholarships to attend tech conferences.

- $200 to [GoBridge][gobridge], an organization that teaches Go to
underrepresented groups.

- $50 to [the OpenBSD Foundation][openbsd], which works on libressl (among
other things).

- $100 to [the Software Freedom Conservancy][sfc] (which hosts Homebrew, Git,
  Mercurial and other projects).

- $100 to [Software in the Public Interest][postgres] (which hosts Postgres)

- $100 to [the Freedom of the Press Foundation][press], which supports Signal.

- $100 to the [National Immigration Law Center][nilc]. Many software engineers
  working in the US are immigrants.

- $7 per month to [npm, Inc](https://npmjs.org).

- $200 to [CARLA][carla]. Housing is a critical issue in San Francisco. The
high price of housing has an adverse effect on our communities and makes it
more difficult for people to move here and get a foothold in a fast growing
economy. CARLA fights NIMBY cities.

### Please tell me how to give you money

In several cases I wanted to give away money and I couldn't figure out how. It
was too difficult to assess an organization's funding situation and figure out
how to donate money; many projects and groups that (I assume) would appreciate
more money didn't explain how to donate, or what they would do with more money.

At the very least, please add the following to your README:

1) Do you need more money?
2) What would you do with more money?
3) How can I give money to you?

At the very least, suggest sending money to a Paypal address; it's not tax
deductible but it's easy for people to give to you.
