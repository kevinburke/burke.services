# Twilio

I worked for three years on Twilio's API team. During that time I worked
extensively on Twilio's API's, client libraries, and product documentation.

I can build any number of Twilio-related products for you or your team, or help
you improve the availability and reliability of your Twilio-based application.

- Several internal projects designed to improve API reliability and stability -
[improving the company's usage of HAProxy, for example][haproxy].

- A [Twilio Client in-browser calling application][client] that was deployed
internally to drive internal usage/testing of Twilio Client.

### Products Built on Twilio

- I wrote [Logrole][logrole], a log viewer designed to replicate the API
dashboard, but with more granular permissions for end users. It's also much
faster than the dashboard. View [a live demo here][logrole-demo].

- I wrote [twilio-go][twilio-go], a Go client library for the Twilio API.
It's the only client library that allows to-the-second filtering of calls and
SMS message logs. It contains smarter types for easy manipulation of your
records. Also you can use contexts to set wall-clock timeouts and easily cancel
outstanding requests.

- I wrote a Node.js API wrapper and Copilot messaging client for the last
company I worked at.

- I built a conference calling app in PHP for a Twilio customer. When a group
member called in, all of the other members would receive an SMS every 90 seconds
asking them to join the conference.

### Videos

At Twiliocon in 2013, I gave a talk about designing great client libraries.

Here's [the contents of the talk in a blog post][client-library-design].

I gave a talk on designing documentation for people that don't read, that
summarized a lot of what we learned at Twilio about how to help people use the
product.
