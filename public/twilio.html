<h1>Twilio</h1>
<p>I worked for three years on Twilio's API team. During that time I worked
extensively on Twilio's API's, client libraries, and product documentation.</p>
<p>I can build any number of Twilio-related products for you or your team, or help
you improve the availability and reliability of your Twilio-based application.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:kev+consulting@inburke.com">Email me!</a></p>
<h3>Products Shipped at Twilio</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Signup and billing flow redesign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embedded code snippets in the documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation IA redesign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several internal projects designed to improve API reliability and stability -
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/engineering/2013/10/16/haproxy">improving the company's usage of HAProxy, for example</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/kevinburke/Twilio-Hackpack-for-Heroku-and-Flask">Twilio Client in-browser calling application</a> that was deployed
internally to drive internal usage/testing of Twilio Client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Products Built on Twilio</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/saintpete/logrole">Logrole</a>, a log viewer designed to replicate the API
dashboard, but with more granular permissions for end users. It's also much
faster than the dashboard. View <a href="https://logrole.herokuapp.com">a live demo here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/kevinburke/twilio-go">twilio-go</a>, a Go client library for the Twilio API.
It's the only client library that allows to-the-second filtering of calls and
SMS message logs. It contains smarter types for easy manipulation of your
records. Also you can use contexts to set wall-clock timeouts and easily cancel
outstanding requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote a Node.js API wrapper and Copilot messaging client for the last
company I worked at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I built a conference calling app in PHP for a Twilio customer. When a group
member called in, all of the other members would receive an SMS every 90 seconds
asking them to join the conference.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>At Twiliocon in 2013, I gave a talk about designing great client libraries.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/client-library-design/">the contents of the talk in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I gave a talk on designing documentation for people that don't read, that
summarized a lot of what we learned at Twilio about how to help people use the
product.</p>
